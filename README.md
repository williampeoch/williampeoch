ğŸ§¬ Biology | ğŸ’‰ Medicine | ğŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence

With a deep passion for these domains, I've immersed myself in biology and dedicated a year to the study of medicine. Currently in my second year of computer science, I am enthusiastically driven by the prospect of merging these disciplines. My ambition is to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to synergize biology and medicine, paving the way for innovative solutions in healthcare. ğŸŒ±ğŸ§ ğŸ’»
